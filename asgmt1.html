							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>During the UTMDigital Openday industrial visit, we attended a session by Oracle Academy and interviewed UTMDigital staff. From the Oracle Academy talk, I learned about the company's commitment to the corporate social responsibility initiative. Oracle is a technology company that can provide database management and cloud infrastructure. The talk provides an overview of how the Oracle technology can support students and provide educational resources through the cloud. It provides an internship and certificate opportunity for students. From the talk, I gained valuable insights into how to manage the database using the Oracle Enterprise Manager, Java, and SQL. Additionally, the interview session helped me understand the responsibilities of UTMDigital which is to strengthen the delivery of ICT services. As the UTMDigital staff, they usually carry out and handle the emails of digital care and fulfill the requirements of UTM system needs such as UTM Smart.</p>
							<p>As a student of computer science, I have to enhance my relevant skills, such as problem-solving, logical thinking, and analytics ability. It is crucial for me to get more internship opportunities in the future academy years. These skills are essential because Oracle Company or UTMDigital looks for students who can break a massive problem into smaller ones and address it by using critical thinking.  </p>
