						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>Through the industry talk of PPG, I learned that PPG maintains high productivity, predicts future risk, and fulfills the requirements of business. I know that PPG is a global coating company and promotes environmental protection. PPG can help decision-making for business and enhance efficiency of work through utilizing the data analytics skills and SAP implementation.</p>
						<p>The industry talk helps me recognize the big impact of a team role in the industry. I learned several core technical skills from the PPG talk, such as data analytics, data management, and machine learning. Thus, I would like to contribute more effort to mastering future IT technologies such as AI-driven operation. I plan to explore how ERP systems like SAP integrate with machine learning algorithms. I hope to ensure the technology can serve both business growth and environmental preservation by strengthening my analytical mindset.</p>
