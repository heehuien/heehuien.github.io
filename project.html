							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>The valuable perspective that I gain from this project is that future digital system technology can enhance our constructive and productive daily lives. The Student Face Scan system designed by our team is intended to enhance campus security and improve operational efficiency. To develop the system, I learned to apply the design thinking phase, which is the empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test phases. I realize that each phase can ensure the precise strategy of the development system and avoid chaos of work.</p>
							<p>Thus, I would like to utilize the design thinking phase to master each project in the upcoming academy years to optimize my task. Moreover, I aim to improve my soft skills such as collaboration, communication, and leadership. Since project is a group work, I am aware it is crucial to push the progress and team members to complete their part and avoid the stagnation of work. Therefore, emotional intelligence plays a significant role in collaborating in teamwork, so I would practice it during my daily life. Additionally, I would like to improve my relevant experience in handling the project. Since I plan to have a relaxed study life during the first semester, I did not attend any cocurricular activities to gain extra experience. Thus, I plan to participate in more activities and events in future academy years.</p>
