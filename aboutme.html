								<p>I am a first-year student majoring in Computer Science (Computer Networking and Security) at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). I plan to explore and participate more activities and events in the upcoming semester. My goal is to gain more experience and knowledge throughout my academic career. I aim to have more opportunities work for my future years.</p>
								<p>Through the ongoing assignment and projects, I realize soft skills are really important to ensure the teamwork is conducted smoothly such as leadership, communication and problem-solving skills. I gain the experience and enhance my emotional intelligence to integrate with others. I sincerely appreciate my peers and lecturers who provided lots of help during the academic semester.</p>
