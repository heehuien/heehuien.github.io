						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>The insight that I gained from the industry talk of Clarity Techworks SDN BHD and Air Asia is that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is vital for fostering efficient communication and developing software that aligns with the strategic vision of the company. It works as a combination of hardware, software, and data, which is important to evolve the company into complex ecosystems such as fintech, e-commerce and digital transformation.</p>
						<p>During the Clarity Techworks session, six speakers shared valuable insights into their skills, job scope needs, career advice, and work experiences. The most impactful advice for me was from CTO Yee Soon Tuck, who emphasized the importance of loving technology and committing to continuous learning to enhance adaptability in the ever-changing ICT landscape. I realize how the experience is important since Mr. Yee as CTO of the company, notes that he would not hire the employee regarding the paper qualification but experience and high motivation to learn.</p>
						<p>During the Air Asia session, I learned that digital transformation is essential to transform the operation of company and customer interactions. Furthermore, I also learned that the daily life of a software engineer requires high levels of teamwork and responsibility through daily stand-ups to remain the project goals. I realize that the communication skill is important to interact with team members as well as people in our daily lives. From the talk, I understand how to maintain productivity by working from home and setting boundaries.</p>
						<p> To improve my own career prospects and stay competitive, I intend to broaden my experiences by attending the conference and workshop especially in the field of cybersecurity. I plan to build a strong showcase of experiences and technical skills through the events. Moreover, I would like to enhance my time management skills since it plays a vital role in balancing the cocurriculum and study life.</p>
