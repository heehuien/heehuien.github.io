						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>The insights of the speaker, TS. HJ. Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib provide a vital perspective on the ethics and practicality of artificial intelligence. The valuable experience that I gained is that we need to apply AI wisely. Although AI enhances work efficiency and saves time in completing tasks, fully relying on it to finish assignments can lead to a loss of critical thinking and comprehension skills. From the experience of the speaker, I realize that it is important to deeply understand the theory of what has been learned in the academy years rather than apply it to pass an exam.</p>
						<p>Therefore, I will utilize the AI intelligently whenever I tackle the assignments and projects. For instance, I will utilize AI to provide me the ideas, optimize my grammar, and generate the initial framework. It brings a massive impact to optimize the tasks without going off-topic or losing the ability to think logically. However, the core contents, creative arguments, and conclusion will be writen by myself. Furthermore, I am committed to thinking out of the box since it is crucial to link the theoretical knowledge to the real-world application. Moreover, I plan to strengthen my relevant skills, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and coordination skills, through mastering each assignment and project.</p>
